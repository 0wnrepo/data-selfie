# dataselfie-dev

### known bugs
- posts like friendship anniversaries and memories are not considered, which sometimes leads to time being added to the previously looked at post
- when Facebook tab has been in the background for a while and you go back the clock might not show up again
- more bugs commented in source code under "// FIX"

### fix for most errors
- "have you tried to turn it on and off again?" - refresh the Facebook tab or close and open a new one

### short cuts
- STATUS BAR [keyword in manifest.json] + tab
- reset db, delete db, init db
